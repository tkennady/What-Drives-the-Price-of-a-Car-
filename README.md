<ul>
    <li><b>Car Age and Mileage:</b>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Age:</b> Newer cars generally come with heftier price tags. Shiny and new always wins!</li>
            <li><b>Mileage:</b> Lower mileage means higher value. Aim for cars with less than 150,000 miles to keep things classy and valuable.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <br>
    <li><b>Manufacturer:</b> Brands like <b>Ford</b>, <b>Chevrolet</b>, and <b>Toyota</b> are gold. These brands are like the celebrities of the car world—always in demand.</li>
    <br>
    <li><b>Car Condition:</b> A car in <b>excellent</b> or <b>like new</b> condition can fetch a premium. It's all about that first impression, so make sure your cars look spiffy.</li>
    <br>
    <li><b>Fuel Type:</b> While <b>gasoline</b> cars are the staple, <b>hybrid</b> and <b>electric</b> cars are the cool kids on the block. They can command higher prices, too.</li>
    <br>
